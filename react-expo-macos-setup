You can still install the expo cli globally though not the current recommendation.
The currently recommended method: using npx directly without a global installation. 
Start by using npx expo <command> directly. It's the easiest way to get going without managing global installations. 
If you run into specific needs for local CLI versions later, you can always adjust.

If you still prefer to install expo-cli globally (though not the current recommendation):

Open your terminal or Command Prompt.

Run the global installation command:

npm install -g expo-cli
